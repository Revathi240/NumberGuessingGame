# NumberGuessingGame
A Number Guessing game is a game built in Java. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it through console input. After each guess, the game provides feedback—whether the guess is too high or too low—until the correct number is guessed until the maximum number of attempts is reached. It's a great beginner-friendly project to practice control flow, loops, and user input in Java.
